How would a human get from point A to point B? What happens if they wander on their own path and not follow your UX flow? What would they do once they see the confirmation page? Or donâ€™t see that at all? This is coming from a place where we should understand that every individual is unique and they have different preferences and methods. We should not expect one UI to be a fit for all or at least millions of people just following the happy path on your product. Human Interactivity is unique, vivid, individualistic and messy. We need to accommodate that in our designs.</p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1513656656/25577044_10155268408691909_585897417_o_zta69j.jpg"><h2 class="gist-content">Resume</h2></div></section></div></main></body><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></html>
