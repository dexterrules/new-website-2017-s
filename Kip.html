We chose this |route because we wanted to gain knowledge about how solid waste management works in Bloomington. Also, we wanted thought it would be interesting to talk to the administrators and educators who work in this field. We searched online and discovered the Monroe County Waste Management organization: the Go Green District. [Insert GGE flow chart]</p><h3 class="head-content">The Design</h3><p class="content is-medium">Our service design is based on information and knowledge exchange, which will happen between Go Green Information and Knowledge Exchange System (GIKES) and residents of Bloomington through our chatbot KIP. GIKES learns from information gathering and presents relevant information to people by getting data from pooled database. As a result, the service gets ‘designed’ and ‘iterated’ as people interact with multiple touch points. So, residents, library enthusiasts and children who are interacting with the service are also being co-designers, because their search queries and overall interaction shapes the entire system. GIKES is a platform and a service, where residents have a good amount of control as co-designers to design the kind of information and knowledge they want. Combined with machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and data mining, GIKES will actively serve the community of Bloomington, while co-designing the service with them as more and more community members engage with the Go Green District.</p></div></div></div></main></body><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></html>
