They also engage in spreading awareness about waste in the community. Currently, they use old school methods of distributing flyers and guides throughout Bloomington, which has limited effectiveness. Also, there is a lack of resources to engage public schools in providing waste management education. Go Green also gets many calls about basic questions such as operation hours or drop-off locations from the residents on a daily basis.</p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1507123122/Kip/stakeholder_map.svg"><h3 class="head-content padup">The Design</h3><h4 class="subhead-content padup">So we thought, as designers, is it possible to design a service which takes care of awareness, information and education distribution across the board, while learning from the community?</h4><p class="content is-medium padup">Our service design is based on information and knowledge exchange, which will happen between Go Green Information and Knowledge Exchange System (GIKES) and residents of Bloomington through our chatbot KIP. GIKES learns from information gathering and presents relevant information to people by getting data from pooled database.</p><div class="level"><div class="level-item"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1507161617/Kip/Diagram_WholeService_v2.png"></div></div><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1507123122/Kip/hierarchy_map.svg"><p class="content is-medium">As a result, the service gets ‘designed’ and ‘iterated’ as people interact with multiple touch points. So, residents, library enthusiasts and children who are interacting with the service are also being co-designers, because their search queries and overall interaction shapes the entire system. GIKES is a platform and a service, where residents have a good amount of control as co-designers to design the kind of information and knowledge they want. Combined with machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and data mining, GIKES will actively serve the community of Bloomington, while co-designing the service with them as more and more community members engage with the Go Green District.</p><h3 class="head-content">Kip the Voice Assistant</h3><p class="content is-medium padup">Along with the help of the Go Green District we designed a service that allows community members to call, text, or message an AI bot named KIP. KIP is a voice assistant/chatbot that answers questions about recycling, waste management, and general inquiries about the Go Green District. The goal with KIP is to design a service that allows the Go Green District to do two things:</p><dl class="content is-medium"><li>Lessen the workload they have everyday of answering the same questions about recycling in Bloomington</li><li>Aggregate the questions and feedback from the community into a knowledge base that allows them to analyze that data and use it to better inform/communicate with the community</li></dl><div class="level padup"><div class="level-item"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/207091504" width="800" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></div></section><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1507165156/Kip/ServiceBlueprint.png"></div></main></body><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></html>
