Social media has fundamentally changed the way people perceive and do things while adding a zest for life. Social media has become an extension of our actual selves and has transformed the way we communicate and socially behave.</h4><h3 class="head-content">The Design</h3><p class="content is-medium"></p></div></section><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1511027286/header%20image/9.jpg"><section class="columns is-centered padder"><div class="column"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1511051950/header%20image/MOSM/3_1.jpg"></div><div class="column"><h3 class="head-content padup">MoSM Selfie Station</h3><p class="content is-medium">Take a group or individual photo at our iconic outdoor photo booth!

We normally do not experience the physicality of getting a like or a comment, or what it means to actually watch snaps on a mobile phone. We have tried to capture those experiences and make them more available in terms of a physical experience form. We used an experience journey map to sketch the flow from getting onboard on a social media site to quitting it and compared it with tangible interactions.</p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1511104844/header%20image/MOSM/mosm-engagement-graph.png"></div></section><section class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-half is-narrow"><p class="content is-medium padder padup">The funnel like shape is to replicate the experience of suffocation. Each room becomes smaller and smaller as you move towards Palace of Peace, making the experience of social media more and more suffocating. This is a symbolic take on our lives and how social media consumes so much of our time, almost suffocating us and leaving no space for other productive activities. This funnel, leads to a Place of Peace where nobody can get a phone network, pushing people to enjoy what nature has to offer. This place reminds people of what they have been missing in life, due to social media, and how they can relish those peaceful moments in nature with the the lack of connectivity. The sudden contrast in funnel like form to an open, courtyard space, will make visitors think about more productive things life has to offer.</p><img class="padup" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1511105858/header%20image/MOSM/unnamed.jpg"></div></section><div class="columns is-centered padup"><div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div><div class="column container has-text-centered"><h3 class="head-content paddown">Read the Documentation</h3><div class="linker"><a href="https://sites.google.com/umail.iu.edu/mosm/design-workbook" target="_blank">Workbook</a></div></div><div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div><div class="column"></div></div><section class="tile-container"><div class="tile-container"><div class="filterContainer"><div class="filterItem interaction research strategy"><a class="tile-box image hvr-bounce-in" href="Stubhub.html"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/sanchitsoni18/image/upload/v1509856348/Thumbnails/Stubhub_Copy_2.svg" alt="Avatar"><h2 class="tile-title fun-hover">STUBHUB</h2><h3 class="tile-subtitle">Summer internship where I worked on community and engagement.
